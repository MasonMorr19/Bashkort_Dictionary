From their earliest days, the brothers showed different natures—Shulgen was bold and impetuous, while Ural was thoughtful and kind.\n\nYanbirde taught his sons the ways of survival and shared with them the great mystery—the existence of Death, the great destroyer who claimed all living things.\n\n\"My sons,\" Yanbirde would say, \"somewhere in this world there must be a way to defeat Death.
